`telescope-repo` is an extension for [telescope.nvim][] that searches the filesystem for *git* (or other SCM[^1], like *Pijul*, *Mercurial*‚Ä¶) repositories. It does not require any setup: the list of repositories is built on the fly over your whole `$HOME`, you don‚Äôt need to manually add projects or open some folders to populate this list, as opposed to [telescope-project.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-project.nvim) or [project.nvim](https://github.com/ahmedkhalf/project.nvim).

Use cases include:
* If you don‚Äôt start vim from the shell (from a GUI or as the start command of a terminal), you are most likely in your `$HOME` directory. You then want to jump into your code as quickly as possible and this plugin can help!
* Sometimes, you have the definition of a function and use of it in different repositories  (e.g. a library you wrote and a program using this library). This plugin helps to open the two, for instance in two splits.
* Use of less popular SCMs: some similar extensions rely on strong conventions to find repositories, like ‚Äúdirectories containing a `.git` file that is also a directory, all inside directory `X`‚Äù. Less popular SCMs like [Pijul][] have a different folder name, and even [`git worktree`][worktree]s don‚Äôt fit neatly into these constraint, with their `.git` *files*.

`telescope-repo.nvim` is based on [telescope-ghq.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-ghq.nvim)

## Installation

You need to add these in your plugin management system:
```lua
'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'
'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim'
'cljoly/telescope-repo.nvim'
```
And optionally, to load the extension:
```lua
require'telescope'.load_extension'repo'
```

### Packer

For instance, with [Packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):
```lua
use 'cljoly/telescope-repo.nvim'
use {
  'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim',
  requires = { {'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'} }
}
```

## External Dependencies

### Required

* [`fd`][] to find the repositories on the filesystem with `list`
* [`plocate`][] or [`locate`][] to find the repositories on the filesystem with `cached_list`

[`fd`]: https://github.com/sharkdp/fd
[`locate`]: https://man.archlinux.org/man/locate.1
[`plocate`]: https://man.archlinux.org/man/plocate.1

### Optional

* [`glow`][] to preview markdown files, will fall back to [`bat`][] if not present (and uses `cat` if neither are present)

[`glow`]: https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow
[`bat`]: https://github.com/sharkdp/bat

## Usage

### list

`:Telescope repo list` or `lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{}`

Running `repo list` and list repositories' paths.

| key              | action               |
|------------------|----------------------|
| `<CR>` (edit)    | `builtin.git_files` for git, falls back to `builtin.find_files` for other SCMs |

#### Options

##### `bin`

Filepath for the binary `fd`.

```vim
" path can be expanded
:Telescope repo list bin=~/fd
```

##### `pattern`

Pattern of the SCM database folder.

Default value: `[[^\.git$]]`

##### `cwd`

Transform the result paths into relative ones with this value as the base dir.

Default value: `vim.fn.getcwd()`

##### `fd_opts`

**This is a relatively advanced option that you should use with caution. There is no guarantee that a particular set of options would work the same across multiple versions**

This passes additional options to the command `fd` that generates the repository list. It is inserted like so:

```
fd [set of default options] [fd_opts] --exec [some default command] [pattern] ‚Ä¶
```

##### Example

Let‚Äôs say you have a git repository `S` inside another git repository `M` (for instance because of [#5](https://github.com/cljoly/telescope-repo.nvim/issues/5)), but `S` is in a directory that‚Äôs ignored in the `.gitignore` in `M`. `S` wouldn‚Äôt appear in the Telescope list of this extension by default, because it is ignored (`.gitignore` are taken into account by default).

To avoid taking into account the `.gitignore`, we need to pass `--no-ignore-vcs` to `fd`, like so (in NeoVim):

```
:lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{fd_opts={'--no-ignore-vcs'}}
```

This will list `M` and `S` in the Telescope output! The downside is that listing repositories will be a little longer, as we don‚Äôt skip the git-ignored files anymore.

##### `tail_path`

Show only basename of the path.

Default value: `false`

##### `shorten_path`

Call `pathshorten()` for each path. This will for instance transform `/home/me/code/project` to `/h/m/c/project`.

Default value: `false`

#### Examples

Here is how you can use this plugin with various SCM:

| SCM    | Command                                                                    |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| git    | `:Telescope repo list` or `lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{}`  |
| pijul  | `lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{pattern=[[^\.pijul$]]}`       |
| hg     | `lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{pattern=[[^\.hg$]]}`          |
| fossil | `lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{pattern=[[^\.fslckout$]]}`    |

Is your favorite SCM missing? It should be straightforward to support it by changing the pattern parameter. If you want it to be considered for addition here, open a PR!

### cached_list

`:Telescope repo cached_list`

This relies on a `locate` command to find repositories. This should be much faster than the `list` command, as it relies on a pre-built index but results may be stalled.

*Note*: at this point, the plugin does not manage index update. Updating the index often requires to run a command like `updatedb` as root.

#### Troubleshooting

You should try to run:
```
sudo updatedb
```
if you encounter any problems. If it‚Äôs not the case by default, you should automate such index update with for instance `cron` or `systemd-timers`. See https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Locate.

#### Options

Options are the similar to `repo list`, bearing in mind that we use `locate` instead of `fd`. Note that:

* `fd_opts` is not supported, as we don‚Äôt use `fd`

#### Examples

##### Exclude Irrelevant Results

Chances are you will get results from folders you don‚Äôt care about like `.cache` or `.cargo`. In that case, you can use the `file_ignore_patterns` option of Telescope, like so (these are lua regexes):

```
:lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.cached_list{file_ignore_patterns={'.cache/', '.cargo/'}}
```

##### Use With Other SCMs

Here is how you can use this plugin with various SCM (we match on the whole path with `locate`, so patterns differ slightly from `repo list`: notice the `^` that becomes a `/`):

| SCM    | Command                                                                    |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| git    | `:Telescope repo list` or `lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{}`  |
| pijul  | `lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{pattern=[[/\.pijul$]]}`       |
| hg     | `lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{pattern=[[/\.hg$]]}`          |
| fossil | `lua require'telescope'.extensions.repo.list{pattern=[[/\.fslckout$]]}`    |

## FAQ

### Getting the repository list is slow

If `:Telescope repo list` is slow, you can use your `.fdignore` to exclude some folders from your filesystem. If there is enough interest, [#1](https://github.com/cljoly/telescope-repo.nvim/issues/1) could further enhance this.
